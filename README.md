**Project: Building a Simple Shell in Unix**

------------------------------------------------------

**General Description:**

This project involves building a simple shell (command-line environment) for the Unix operating system. The shell should provide the following functionalities:

* **Command Execution:**
    * Ability to create child processes and execute commands using system calls.
* **History:**
    * Maintaining a history of commands entered by the user.
    * Ability to view and re-execute commands from the history.
* **Input/Output Redirection:**
    * Ability to redirect the input and output of commands to and from files or other devices.
* **Pipe Communication:**
    * Ability to communicate between commands using pipes and pass the output of one command as input to another.

------------------------------------------------------

**Features:**

* **Command History:**
    * Managing a history file to store entered commands.
* **File Management:**
    * Ability to redirect input from a file to commands.
    * Ability to redirect the output of commands to a file.
* **Advanced History Management:**
    * Ability to clear the command history.

------------------------------------------------------

**Language and Tools:**

The use of any programming language and libraries is allowed. To implement the shell, you will need to use system calls such as `dup()`, `fork()`, `pipe()`, etc.

------------------------------------------------------

**Additional Notes:**

* The shell should be implemented in a modular way, with each feature implemented as a separate function or module.
* The shell should be well-documented, with clear comments explaining the code.
* The shell should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly.

------------------------------------------------------

**Improvement Ideas:**

* Implement additional features such as:
    * Tab completion
    * Command aliases
    * Job control
    * Signal handling
